We have started working on **PACKAGE.broker**, a private Composer mirror designed for security and compliance.

This project aims to provide a minimalistic, SOC-2 compatible solution for hosting private PHP packages. While it is fully compatible with serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers, its core mission is focused on security, auditability, and efficiency.

Stay tuned for more updates!
